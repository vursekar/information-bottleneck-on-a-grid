# Information Bottleneck on a Grid
Python implementation of tabular information bottleneck iterative algorithm formulated in Tishby et al.(2000), https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057.pdf. Tested on a 2D integer lattice, where each point is mapped to a binary variable with a conditional probability distribution that is dependent on the sign of the product of its components.
